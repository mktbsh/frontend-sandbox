# frontend-sandbox

Front-end application implementation testing environment.
Astro is used to test the operation of any of React, Vue.js, and Svelte frameworks.

This repository is also a collection of snippets for yourself. It exists to test whether it can be deployed in a production environment, so easy copy/paste is not recommended.
